# Nomos Protocol

A Cybernetic Social Contract for Economic Motion

Velocity-targeted issuance. Human-verified integrity. Immutable constitution. No pre-mine. Fair genesis.

## Overview

Nomos is a decentralized economic layer that ties token issuance to verifiable transaction velocity and human contribution. It solves wealth stagnation, computational centralization, and social exclusion through an **Economy of Motion** — where value flows rather than hoards.

Core mechanics include:
- 3-way reward split per transaction (sender rebate, receiver bonus, node compensation)
- Elastic velocity coefficient targeting monthly full-supply circulation
- Locked rewards until claimed via personal labor or delegated pools
- Threshold-gated safety net for low-balance participants
- Anti-manipulation flagging with user-choice resolution
- Revocable privacy tiers with reward disincentives

## Whitepaper

**v1.5 — January 2026**


## Key Principles

- Keep value moving
- Keep infrastructure distributed
- Keep humans in the loop where it matters

No automated system may impose irreversible harm.

## Getting Involved

We seek the first citizens to:
- Run Hydra nodes (edge compute/storage)
- Participate as jurors or reviewers
- Operate as Lex Merchants (reputation-verified utility providers)
- Contribute to protocol development or testing

No team tokens. No pre-mine. No centralized control.
