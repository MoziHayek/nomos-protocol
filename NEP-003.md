# NEP-003: Universal Basic Labor (UBL) Adjudication Layer

**Author:** Mozi Hayek
**Status:** Draft  
**Module:** `x/ubl`  
**Dependencies:** `x/zkbio` (Liveness verification), `x/synthesis` (AI anomaly detection), VRF (Verifiable Random Function)

## 1. Abstract
This specification defines the `x/ubl` module, the decentralized human oracle and cognitive immune system of the Nomos protocol. It provides a mechanism to resolve subjective physical-world disputes and combat sophisticated AI-driven Sybil attacks that bypass hardware-level biometric verification.

## 2. Rationale
Blockchains are deterministic state machines; they cannot parse subjective physical reality. While the `x/synthesis` AI Sentinel can detect anomalous economic behavior (e.g., thousands of wallets transacting with perfect, non-human synchronization), an AGI cannot be granted the unilateral power to revoke identities without violating Axiom 3 (Universal Impartiality). 

Nomos relies on localized human cognition to evaluate subjective evidence. The network economically incentivizes honest adjudication through Schelling Point Game Theory, paying out the recovered funds as a Universal Basic Labor (UBL) wage.



## 3. Architecture Overview

### 3.1 The Trigger Mechanism
A UBL bounty is generated via two pathways:
1. **P2P Escrow Dispute:** Two users contest the outcome of a physical trade (e.g., item not received). Both parties submit encrypted subjective evidence (photos, chat logs) and a staked bond.
2. **AI Sentinel Flag (`x/synthesis`):** The network's AI flags a cluster of `x/zkbio` nullifiers for executing highly improbable, machine-optimized economic loops, suspected of being a coordinated Sybil attack to drain the `x/velocity` mint.

### 3.2 The VRF Juror Draft
Once triggered, the protocol utilizes a cryptographic Verifiable Random Function (VRF) to select an odd number of "Jurors" (e.g., $N=11$) from the pool of currently active, ZK-Bio verified humans.
* **Anonymity:** Jurors are completely anonymous to each other and to the defendants. 
* **Opt-In:** Drafted humans receive a secure prompt on their device. Participation is strictly voluntary.



### 3.3 Schelling Point Consensus
Jurors review the decrypted evidence (or the behavioral CAPTCHA data of the suspected AI wallets) and cast a blind vote.
* To prevent bribery and enforce objective truth, Nomos utilizes a Schelling Point incentive structure. 
* Jurors cannot communicate. They are economically forced to guess what the *majority* of other rational humans will perceive as the obvious truth.

### 3.4 Settlement & Payout
Upon the expiration of the voting window, the `x/ubl` module tallies the votes:
* **The Majority:** Jurors who voted with the majority consensus split the bounty (either the forfeited P2P escrow bond or a payout from the network treasury).
* **The Minority:** Jurors who voted against the consensus receive zero UNITT (and may face a temporary cooldown from future UBL drafts to disincentivize random clicking).
* **Sybil Execution:** If the consensus rules that a wallet cluster is a synthetic AI construct, the associated `x/zkbio` nullifiers are permanently burned, and the funds are returned to the treasury.
