**The Nomos Constitution (v1.0)**
A Cybernetic Social Contract
Preamble
Nomos exists to enable continuous economic motion, distributed infrastructure, and inclusive participation without coercion. The protocol is designed to reward contribution, preserve human agency, and correct itself over time through transparent incentives and accountable governance.
Participation in Nomos is voluntary, revocable, and governed by this Constitution.

**Article I — Voluntary Participation**
All participation in Nomos is opt-in.
No user is required to transact, labor, host infrastructure, govern, or adjudicate disputes.
No identity, device, or wallet is obligated to remain active once participation ceases.

**Article II — Economic Motion**
Nomos rewards verified economic activity, infrastructure contribution, and human labor.
Value is minted only in response to real transactions, verified work, or network service.
Hoarding is discouraged by time-bounded rewards; circulation is preserved through voluntary delegation, not forced seizure.

**Article III — Property & Asset Sovereignty**
All assets owned by a participant are their property.
Nomos may escrow rewards under dispute, but shall not permanently confiscate assets without human adjudication.
Earned assets not under active dispute remain transferable at all times.

**Article IV — Right to Exit**
Any participant may exit Nomos at any time.
Exit guarantees:
unrestricted transfer of owned assets,
preservation of balances and undisputed rewards,
immunity from new penalties or reputation changes after exit.
Exit does not void:
disputes formally initiated prior to exit,
obligations voluntarily staked on-chain,
time-bound contracts explicitly consented to.
No penalty, mark, or classification shall be applied solely for exercising the right to exit.

**Article V — Reputation & Agency**
Reputation is earned through verified contribution, uptime, labor, and honest adjudication.
Reputation may decay through inactivity or proven abuse, but may not be destroyed solely by automated systems.
Reputation is non-transferable and reflects past participation, not moral worth.

**Article VI — Human Mitigation & Due Process**
No participant shall suffer irreversible economic or reputational harm without access to human review.
Automated systems may:
flag behavior,
escrow rewards,
impose temporary limits.
Automated systems may not:
issue final judgments,
permanently seize assets,
irreversibly destroy reputation.
All participants are guaranteed escalation to human mitigation via designated reviewers or the Nomos Jury.
The burden of proof rests on the accuser or triggering system.

**Article VII — Justice & Adjudication**
Disputes are resolved by independent, high-reputation human jurors.
Economic stakes deter spam and reward truthful consensus.
Clear-evidence dissent and manipulation are penalized through reputation loss.
Justice exists to restore trust, not extract punishment.

**Article VIII — Governance & Evolution**
Nomos evolves through on-chain governance.
Protocol parameters, treasury allocation, and upgrades require quorum, transparent voting, and time-locked execution.
No governance action may violate Articles I–VI.

**Article IX — Neutrality & Inclusion**
Nomos does not discriminate by geography, wealth, ideology, or status.
Low-resource participants may enter through verifiable human labor and graduate through reputation.
Access is earned through contribution, not permission.

Closing Principle
Nomos shall remain:
voluntary in participation,
human-governed at the point of harm,
reversible by exit,
adaptive without coercion.
Any mechanism that violates these principles is invalid, regardless of efficiency.
